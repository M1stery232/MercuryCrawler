      "bio": "I'm a tech entrepreneur and angel investor on a mission to end aging. In college I focused on neuroscience and did some MRI-based research at Mass General Hospital. I've also been interested in aging and longevity since first hearing the concept of Longevity Escape Velocity in 2007. Since graduating I built and sold 4 companies, reaching over 80 million users. I'm a self-taught software engineer and highly operational CEO, largely with a product inclination, at the 4 companies. I love the intersection of behavior and tech. In the past 18 months, anguished by the unnecessary deaths and institutional incompetence in COVID, I've concluded that \"nobody is coming to the rescue\" and that I must take more direct action in the aging space. While great people already work to end aging, we need at least 3 orders of magnitude more resources to see major results in 20-40 years. While aging is my core focus I also have invested opportunistically.",
